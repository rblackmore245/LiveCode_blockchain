LiveCode_blockchain is a simple blockchain application written in LiveCode. It provides a complete example of a blockchain network with the ability to send and receive transactions. The transactions are secured using the SHA256 hashing algorithm, and the consensus algorithm used is Proof of Stake (POS).

## Features

- Create a new wallet with a unique address
- View the balance of a wallet
- Send transactions to other wallets
- Receive transactions from other wallets
- Verify the integrity of the blockchain using hashing
- Achieve consensus through the POS algorithm

## Prerequisites

- LiveCode IDE installed (version X.X.X or higher)
- Basic understanding of blockchain concepts
- Familiarity with LiveCode programming language

## Installation

1. Clone or download the LiveCode_blockchain repository to your local machine.
2. Open the LiveCode IDE.
3. Open the project in the IDE by selecting "File" -> "Open Stack" and selecting the `LiveCode_blockchain.livecode` file.
4. Make sure to have the necessary dependencies installed (if any).
5. Build and run the application in the LiveCode IDE or export it as a standalone application.

## Usage

1. Launch the LiveCode_blockchain application.
2. Create a new wallet by selecting the "Create Wallet" option.
3. Note down the wallet address displayed on the screen. This will be your unique identifier for receiving transactions.
4. View the balance of your wallet by selecting the "View Balance" option and entering your wallet address.
5. Send transactions to other wallets by selecting the "Send Transaction" option and providing the recipient's wallet address and the amount to be sent.
6. Receive transactions by sharing your wallet address with others. Any transactions sent to your address will be reflected in your balance.
7. Verify the integrity of the blockchain by selecting the "Verify Blockchain" option. The application will calculate the hash of each block and ensure that they are correctly linked.
8. The POS consensus algorithm will automatically validate and add new blocks to the blockchain based on the available stake.
